## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
```
```{r}
library("janitor")
```



```{r}
ecosphere<-read.csv("data/ecs21351-sup-0003-SupplementS1.csv", skip=2)
ecosphere
```
```{r}
ecosphere<- janitor::clean_names(ecosphere)
```

```{r}
names(ecosphere)
```

```{r}
tabyl(ecosphere$diet)
```

```{r}
veggie<- filter(ecosphere, diet=="Vegetation")
```

```{r}
veggie %>% 
  select(common_name,family,diet)
```
```{r}
ecosphere %>% 
  filter(diet=="Vegetation") %>% 
  select(family,diet) %>% 
  tabyl(diet)
```
